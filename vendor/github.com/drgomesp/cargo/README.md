### Introduction

**cargo** is a library that provides a powerful way of handling objects and
 their dependencies, by using the *Container*. The container works
 by implementing the [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
 pattern via constructor injection, resulting in explicit dependencies and the achievement
 of the [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) principle.

### Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/drgomesp/cargo
```

### Getting Started

#### Creating/Registering Services

There are two main methods used to define services in the container: `container.Register`
and `container.Set`. The first one assumes you already have a pointer to an object instance
to work with, the second needs a **definition**.

Suppose you have an object:

```go
type HttpClient struct {}

client := new(HttpClient)
```

To define that as a service, all you need to do is:

```go
dic := container.NewContainer()
dic.Set("http.client", client)
```

From now on, whenever you need to work with the http client service, you can simply do:

```go
if s, err := dic.Get("http.client"); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

client := s.(*HttpClient) // the type assertion is required
```

Or, if you do not need errors handling and panic is fine, you can get the same behavior with short synthax:

```go
client := dic.MustGet("http.client").(*HttpClient)
```
